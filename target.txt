AI-Powered System for Illegal Website & Gambling Detection
 in Indonesia
 Indonesia is facing a rapid rise in illegal online activities such as gambling websites,
 defacement of government and academic sites, and the use of digital payments for unlawful
 purposes. Traditional blocking methods (domain/IP takedowns) are reactive and often slow,
 allowing operators to quickly shift to new domains. This plan introduces an AI-powered system
 designed to strengthen Indonesia’s national cybersecurity posture by detecting, analyzing, and
 mapping illegal online operations. The approach focuses not only on websites but also on
 payment channels and operator networks, which are harder to replace and therefore more
 effective choke points.
 Goals of the System
 • Detect and classify illegal websites (gambling, scams, harmful tutorials).
 • Identify payment channels (QRIS, e-wallets, phone numbers) used by operators.
 • Map operator ecosystems (shared servers, domain clusters, link networks).
 • Generate actionable intelligence reports for Kominfo and partners.
 • Strengthen trust in Indonesian online spaces (government, education, business).
 Global Benchmarks & Competitors
 Other countries and organizations are already deploying similar systems for national security
 and online fraud detection: - Singapore’s **Cyber Security Agency (CSA)** works closely with
 banks and ISPs to block illegal domains and track payment abuse. - Europol and Interpol have
 run international operations shutting down gambling and scam websites by mapping hosting
 providers and payment networks. - China’s **Great Firewall** incorporates automated
 monitoring and domain blocking at scale, including gambling content. - Private companies
 such as **Group-IB** and **Recorded Future** sell AI-powered monitoring platforms to
 governments worldwide. This means Indonesia is not alone in facing the threat—competitors
 and allies alike are already using advanced AI-based monitoring to protect their digital
 ecosystems.
 Why This Matters for Indonesia
 • Protect citizens from gambling, scams, and harmful online material.
 • Safeguard government and academic credibility from defacement attacks.
 • Disrupt illegal operators at their financial choke points (e-wallets, QRIS, bank accounts).
 • Build stronger cooperation between Kominfo, ISPs, and payment providers.
 • Elevate Indonesia’s cybersecurity standing to match global best practices.
 Planned Approach
 The system will use AI-based crawling and analysis to automatically find illegal domains, follow
 their link networks, and extract payment information. Suspicious websites will be scored for
 severity, clustered into operator groups, and matched with payment channels. Weekly
 intelligence reports will summarize the findings in human-readable form, enabling Kominfo and
 partners to act quickly—blocking domains, reporting wallets, and taking down hosting
providers. This approach is proactive and scalable, reducing the chance of illegal operators
 staying hidden in Indonesia’s online ecosystem.
 By developing this system, Indonesia will not only counter current illegal activities but also
 create a long-term foundation for defending against evolving online threats. With competitors
 already deploying similar technologies worldwide, this project ensures that Indonesia does not
 fall behind in the cybersecurity race
